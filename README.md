## Problem statement
AtliQo is one of the leading telecom providers in India and launched its 5G plans in May 2022 along with other telecom providers.

However, the management noticed a decline in their active users and revenue growth post-5G launch in May 2022. AtliQo’s business director requested their analytics team to provide a comparison report of KPIs between pre and post-periods of the 5G launch. The management is keen to compare the performance between these periods and get insights that would enable them to make informed decisions to recover their active user rate and other key metrics. They also wonder if they can optimize their internet plans to get more active users.  Peter Pandey, a junior data analyst, is assigned to this task.

### Task List
You are a data analyst who has been provided with sample data to work on the following tasks.
- Create the comparison report based on the mock-up provided. Please note the mock-up is created by a business user who has a minimal idea about dashboarding. Hence, you need to represent the insights in a much better way.
- The target audience of this dashboard is top-level management - hence the dashboard should be self-explanatory and easy to understand.
- Create relevant insights not provided in the metric list/mock-up dashboard to support the cause.

## Things that I learned from this Project
- I Learned, how to use bookmarks and selection for different purposes. (Page navigation buttons in the dashboard were achieved using bookmarks and selection same as a website page navigation.
- Tried using the color palette and sticking with those colors throughout the dashboard ([Color palette link](https://colorhunt.co/palette/eef5ffb4d4ff86b6f6176b87))

- Plans without daily data packs such as p10 with 3 days validity, p9 of Talktime, and p8 with 1-day validity posted nil revenue.
- Plans such as p7, p5, p6, and p4 were either without a daily refilling option or had low validity periods saw double-digit revenue growth decline post 5G rollout.

## Potential Decisions
1. **Revenue Optimization Strategies:**
   - Evaluate the performance of plans introduced after the 5G rollout (p11 and p12), which contributed significantly to revenue. Consider promoting or enhancing these plans further to maintain or increase revenue.
   - Focus on marketing and promoting daily data packs (3 GB, 2 GB, 1.5 GB, 1GB, and 1.8 GB) with an average 2-month validity, as they have shown positive contribution to revenue.

2. **Market Share Improvement:**
   - Analyze the market share trends across cities where AtliQo attempted to gain market share both before and after the 5G rollout. Identify successful strategies and implement them in other cities.
   - Monitor competitors' activities in cities where market share declined to identify areas for improvement and regain lost market share.

3. **User Retention Strategies:**
   - Address the decline in Total Active Users (TAU) post-5G rollout by understanding user preferences and expectations. Consider introducing targeted promotions or incentives to retain existing users.
   - Investigate reasons for the increase in Total Unsubscribed Users (TUU) after 5G and develop strategies to minimize churn, possibly by enhancing service quality or addressing customer concerns.

4. **Plan Effectiveness Analysis:**
   - Assess the performance of plans like p7, p5, p6, and p4, which experienced a decline in revenue growth post-5G rollout. Consider re-evaluating or phasing out these plans if they are not aligning with customer preferences.

5. **Regional Strategies:**
   - Given the regional variations in performance, tailor marketing and promotional activities based on regional preferences and demands.
   - Leverage insights from high-performing regions (e.g., Mumbai for revenue, Patna for ARPU, and Pune for TAU) to inform strategies for other regions.

6. **Competitor Analysis:**
   - Conduct a comprehensive analysis of competitors, especially those surpassing AtliQo in market share. Identify their successful strategies and consider implementing similar approaches to stay competitive.

7. **Internet Plans Optimization:**
   - Explore opportunities to optimize internet plans based on user preferences and market demands. Consider conducting surveys or seeking feedback to understand customer needs better.

8. **Communication and Marketing:**
   - Enhance communication strategies to educate users about the benefits of 5G plans and the value proposition of AtliQo's offerings.
   - Consider targeted marketing campaigns highlighting the advantages of plans introduced after 5G rollout to attract new users.

9. **Monitoring and Adaptation:**
