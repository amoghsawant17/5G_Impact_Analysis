## Problem statement
AtliQo is one of the leading telecom providers in India and launched its 5G plans in May 2022 along with other telecom providers.

However, the management noticed a decline in their active users and revenue growth post 5G launch in May 2022. AtliQoâ€™s business director requested their analytics team to provide a comparison report of KPIs between pre and post-periods of the 5G launch. The management is keen to compare the performance between these periods and get insights that would enable them to make informed decisions to recover their active user rate and other key metrics. They also wonder if they can optimize their internet plans to get more active users.  Peter Pandey, a junior data analyst, is assigned to this task.

### Task List
You are a data analyst who has been provided with sample data to work on the following tasks.
- Create the comparison report based on the mock-up provided. Please note the mock-up is created by a business user who has minimal idea about dashboarding. Hence, you need to represent the insights in a much better way.
- The target audience of this dashboard is top-level management - hence the dashboard should be self-explanatory and easy to understand.
- Create relevant insights not provided in the metric list/mock-up dashboard to support the cause.

## Things that I learned from this Project
- I Learned, how to use bookmarks and selection for different purposes. (Page navigation buttons in the dashboard were achieved using bookmarks and selection same as a website page navigation.
- Tried using the color palette and sticking with those colors throughout the dashboard ([Color palette link](https://colorhunt.co/palette/eef5ffb4d4ff86b6f6176b87))
